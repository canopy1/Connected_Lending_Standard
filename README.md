# Connected_lending_Standard
Connected lending Standard (CLS) is an open source format for credit and loan policies.
One of the things that we (Canopy) found out is that almost every single credit card and loan company has a different way to articulate their policies.

Our goal is to unify the way people talk about credit and loan policies.

#Here are some benefits:

Banks:   can more quickly evaluate new products

Lenders: can more easily express themselves to others

Consumers: can more easily understand how their products work

#Planned releases:

Q2 2022: examples of all known credit card policies used in the US

Q3 2022: easier to consume data format

Q4 2022: easier searching/indexing of all known policies
